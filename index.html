          <h3>The Exact Steps I Followed to Become a Millionaire in Few Years</h3>
          <p>In 2005, I began with zero budget... and by 2013, I made my first
          million dollars.<br><br>Success in life is all about knowing how successful
          people forced their way through the obstacles they came across until they made
          it. I bet you know many success stories but the lack of details
          about those stories makes it so hard for you to know what exactly
          those people did in order to become successful.<br><br>I am pretty sure
          the longest success story you know can be written in few pages and
          such lack of detail is the main reason why you don't know exactly
          how you should proceed.<br><br>In this book, I wrote down my journey
          in full detail, starting from the time I was 15 years old and up 'till I
          became a millionaire so that you know exactly how to force your way
          through life and make your dreams come true.<br><br>The story
          includes the full details of the tens, if not <em>hundreds</em>, of obstacles
          I came across, the tens of failures I faced, the emotional
          shocks I have been through, the serious life decisions I took,
          the horrible mistakes I made, and the exact steps I followed to get
          out of each of those problems.</p>

          <h3>What's The Difference Between This Book & "How I Did It"</h3>
          <p>While my book "How I Did It" explains in detail how you can start
             a successful online business, this book explains the steps you need
             to do in order to become successful in life.<br><br>The book "How
             I Did It" is a guide to creating an online business while this
             book is a guide for any person who wants to know how success works.
             "From 0 to 1 Million" is a must-have for any person who is serious
             about achieving success and/or happiness in life.</p>
